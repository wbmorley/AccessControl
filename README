Project for implementing access control 

This project was done to implement access control of a fake simplified facebook page. 
There is a profile owner which can have any amount of friends that must be added to view the page. 
A friend can be added to zero or more lists. Only the profile owner can perform admin tasks 
such as adding friends, creating lists, assigning friends to a list, changing owners 
and setting access controls for reading and writing comments on posted pictures to the wall. 

The program is run from the command line using an instruction file that contains a
variety of the following commands:

syntax for command:
command (parameters)

friendadd (friendname) : adds a friend with the name friendname 
viewby (friendname): friend with friendname views the profile
